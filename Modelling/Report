With the corrente data was possible to build a predictive machine to predict heart risk disease. 
The best model was made with a random forest algorithm against four kinds of algorithm. 
It's still needs to check some relevant points about recall and precision metrics, cause the most 
suitable idea is the modeltends to make more false positive errors around the presence of heart risk.
